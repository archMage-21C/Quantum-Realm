### Unit I: Ray Optics

**Ray Optics** provides the essential foundation for understanding how light behaves, while it may seem like a purely classical topic, mastering ray optics is crucial because the intuition and principles developed here are directly applied to the design and function of components used in quantum photonics.

### Part 1: Core Principles and Foundations

The first section covers the fundamental postulates of ray optics and the laws derived from them. The key idea is that light travels in straight lines until it encounters a boundary or a medium with a varying refractive index.

- **Maxwell's Equations:** Although ray optics is a simplified model, it begins by acknowledging the full electromagnetic theory. It's important to understand that Maxwell's equations are the ultimate source of all light phenomena, and ray optics is a high-frequency (short wavelength) approximation. It's required to know the four equations and what they describe (e.g., Gauss's Law, Faraday's Law).

- **The Ray Postulate & Fermat's Principle:** The two core pillars of ray optics.
    - The **Ray Postulate** states that light travels in straight lines in a homogeneous medium. 
    - **Fermat's Principle** explains refraction and reflection by stating that light takes the path of least time between two points. Understanding this principle provides a deeper "why" for Snell's Law.

- **Snell's Law of Refraction and the Law of Reflection:** These are the practical applications of Fermat's principle. Their application is needed to be able to solve problems involving light passing through boundaries.

- **Total Internal Reflection (TIR):** A critical phenomenon that occurs when light travels from a denser medium to a less dense one at an angle greater than the critical angle. This is the operating principle behind optical fibers and waveguides.

### Part 2: Optical Components and Systems

This section applies the fundamental laws to common optical devices. The practical skills required for designing and analyzing simple optical setups can be developed through here.

- **Mirrors and Lenses:** Studying how spherical mirrors and lenses form images. Also, usage of the **thin-lens equation** and the **magnification formula**. Awareness about common **aberrations**, which are the limitations of these simple models.

- **Ray-Transfer Matrix (ABCD Matrix):** This is a powerful and elegant method for tracing a ray's position and angle through a sequence of optical elements. For each component (e.g., free space, a lens, a mirror), there is a corresponding 2×2 matrix. By multiplying these matrices in order, the final position and angle of a ray after passing through a complex system can be derived.
    - This matrix formalism is particularly important as it has a direct analogy to the propagation of light modes in resonators and even the evolution of quantum states in certain systems.

- **Graded-Index (GRIN) Optics:** This topic moves beyond homogeneous media. Here, the refractive index is a function of position, causing rays to follow curved paths. An understanding of how GRIN lenses and fibers can focus light without traditional curved surfaces can be developed here.

### Part 3: Why Ray Optics is Critical for Quantum Computing

In Quantum Communication and Sensing, the concepts in ray optics, while classical, have direct quantum parallels.

- **Waveguides and Photonic Integrated Circuits:** The concept of a classical waveguide, which relies on TIR, translates directly to a quantum photonic circuit. These on-chip devices are used to guide and manipulate single photons for quantum communication and computation. Understanding how to design them classically is the first step to designing their quantum counterparts.

- **Beam Splitters as Quantum Gates:** In quantum optics, a classical beam splitter is no longer just a device that splits a light ray. It becomes a **quantum gate** that operates on single-photon states. It acts as a **Hadamard gate** in a two-pathway interferometer, creating a superposition of a photon being in both paths simultaneously.

- **Resonators and Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics (Cavity QED):** The use of mirrors to form an optical resonator, introduced in classical optics, is fundamental to Cavity QED. This field studies the strong interaction between a quantum emitter (like a single atom or a quantum dot) and a single photon confined within a cavity. This is a core technology for building quantum nodes and single-photon sources.

- **The Photon as the "Quantum Ray":** Ultimately, in quantum optics, the "ray" is replaced by a quantum particle—the photon. While photons are described by wave functions, their paths are often modeled using the same components (lenses, mirrors, beam splitters). The key difference is that a single photon can be in a superposition of multiple "ray paths," a phenomenon that has no classical counterpart.
