# The Postulates of Ray Optics
---
Ray optics, also known as geometrical optics, is the simplest theory of light. It describes light as rays that travel in different optical media according to a set of geometric rules. This theory is an approximation that adequately describes many daily experiences with light but cannot account for phenomena like interference and diffraction.

The theory is built on a set of core postulates:

### Postulates of Ray Optics

1. **Light Travels in Rays:** Light is emitted by sources and travels in the form of rays. These rays can be detected by an optical detector.
    
2. **Refractive Index:** An optical medium is characterized by its **refractive index**, denoted by the variable n≥1. The refractive index is defined as the ratio of the speed of light in free space ($c_0​$) to the speed of light in the medium ($c$), so that $n=\frac{c_{0}}{c}$. This means that the time taken for light to travel a distance d in the medium is $\frac{d}{c}=\frac{nd}{c_{0}}$. The quantity $nd$ is called the **optical path length**. In an inhomogeneous medium, the refractive index $n(r)$ is a function of position, and the optical path length between two points $A$ and $B$ is calculated by integrating along the path:
    $$
    Optical\space pathlength=\int^{B}_{A}n(r)ds
    $$

3. **Fermat's Principle:** This is the most important postulate of ray optics. It states that an optical ray traveling between two points, A and B, follows a path that takes the least amount of time, or equivalently, has the minimum optical path length. This principle forms the basis for the laws of reflection and refraction.

### Elaboration: The Laws of Reflection and Refraction

The familiar laws of reflection and refraction can be derived from Fermat's Principle.

#### Law of Reflection

For a ray of light reflecting off a mirror, the law of reflection states that the reflected ray lies in the plane of incidence, and the angle of reflection equals the angle of incidence. 

This can be proven by finding the path of minimum distance for a ray traveling from point $A$ to point $B$ after reflecting off a mirror. The shortest path is a straight line, which occurs when the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection ($\theta = \theta^′$).

#### Law of Refraction (Snell's Law)

When a ray of light passes from one medium to another with different refractive indices, a portion of the light is reflected, and a portion is transmitted (refracted). The refracted ray obeys the law of refraction, or Snell's law:
$$
n_{1}​sin\theta_{1}​=n_{2}sin\theta_{2}​
$$
Here, $\theta_{1}$ and $\theta_{2}$ ​ are the angles of incidence and refraction, and $n_{1}$ and $n_{2}$ ​ are the refractive indices of the two media. A consequence of this law is **total internal reflection**, which occurs when a ray travels from a higher index medium to a lower index medium at an angle greater than the critical angle. Total internal reflection is the principle behind many optical devices, including optical fibers.

Ray optics uses these three simple rules—light travels in straight lines, the law of reflection, and the law of refraction—to model how light interacts with various optical components like mirrors, prisms, and lenses. The principles are applied without further reference to Fermat's principle. However, it's important to remember that these relationships are approximate and hold only for **paraxial rays**, which are rays that make small angles with the optical axis.
